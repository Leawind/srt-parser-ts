<i>Over the course
of 1,000 years,</i>

3
00:01:46,617 --> 00:01:49,248
<i>the spiritual energy
of heaven and earth</i>

4
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,148
<i>gave birth to the
Chaos Pearl.</i>

5
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,849
<i>Feeding off the
sun and moon,</i>

6
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:57,016
<i>its power grew
at an unstoppable rate.</i>

7
00:01:57,018 --> 00:01:59,849
<i>The divine and demonic
life forces it absorbed</i>

8
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:00,682
<i>fused together,</i>

9
00:02:00,684 --> 00:02:03,882
<i>making it unstoppable
and no less hungry.</i>

10
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:06,749
<i>So my master,
the supreme lord of heaven,</i>

11
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:11,482
<i>sent my brother and I
to put a stop to the chaos.</i>

12
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:12,415
<i>I know what
you're thinking,</i>

13
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,515
<i>"Who's that dashing rogue
on the pig?"</i>

14
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:17,115
That would be me, Taiyi Zhenren.

15
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:19,415
<i>And If I weren't so busy
being a super impressive</i>

16
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:20,882
<i>butt-kicking,
day-saving monk,</i>

17
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:23,183
<i>I've been told
I could be a model.</i>

18
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:26,882
Chaos Pearl.

19
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:28,016
You can't escape.

20
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:30,584
This is the end of the line.

21
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,148
Don't scare it, you big meanie.

22
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,448
Go on. There's a good pearl.

23
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,048
Come here. Here, boy!

24
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,417
Or girl?

25
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,181
Uh...

26
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,715
It's over!

27
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:10,549
It absorbs energy!

28
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,148
You bruised my moneymaker.

29
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,949
Someone needs a time out.

30
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,384
Hit me now. I dare ya!

31
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,684
I was just playin' around?

32
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,949
- Master!
- Master!

33
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,148
I have divided
the Chaos Pearl into two parts,

34
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,849
The Spirit Pearl
and the Demon Pill.

35
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:39,016
The Demon Pill is dangerous
and nearly indestructible.

36
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:41,482
I'm casting a heaven-made curse,

37
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:44,315
a lightning bolt that
will seek out and destroy it

38
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,382
in three years' time.

39
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:48,982
Until that day,
you must stay vigilant

40
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,649
and watch over it.

41
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:54,849
Li Jing has won my favor
in battle.

42
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:57,315
And so, the Spirit Pearl

43
00:04:57,317 --> 00:05:00,715
will be reincarnated
into his third-born son.

44
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:06,016
I shall entrust this task
to you, my disciple.

45
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:07,215
Huh?

46
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:08,181
Right now,

47
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,181
Eleven Golden Immortals
sit beside me.

48
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:14,315
If the pearl
is successfully reincarnated,

49
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:16,448
then you shall join me

50
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,482
in the Court of Heaven.

51
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,016
You can count on me, master.

52
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:21,384
Thank you so much!

53
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:25,148
Once the Spirit Pearl is born

54
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,450
call him...

55
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:30,217
Ne Zha.

56
00:05:40,384 --> 00:05:41,482
<i>♪ I love a party ♪</i>

57
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:43,016
<i>♪ And parties love me ♪</i>

58
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:44,749
<i>♪ It's baby time ♪</i>

59
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:48,882
Mm! Ha!

60
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:51,016
How 'bout a swiggy
for the piggy?

61
00:06:05,484 --> 00:06:07,549
Please.

62
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,617
Careful.

63
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,749
Dear, you should worship too.

64
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,682
Why didn't I think of that?

65
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:22,048
I've only been pregnant
for three years!

66
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:35,916
From the Cave of Golden Light,

67
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:37,749
my name is Taiyi Zhen...

68
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:39,784
ren.

69
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:44,016
- Come on.
- Wait for me!

70
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:46,348
- Hurry up! Move it, slowpoke!
- Come on!

71
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,882
- Yeah, slowpoke!
- Come on!

72
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:49,517
This is so exciting.

73
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:56,482
A third son! Congratulations!

74
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:59,148
I'll be a matchmaker
for the little man.

75
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,415
We wrote him a song.
Wanna hear it?

76
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:07,148
Thank you for your concern
and well-wishes, my friends.

77
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,515
But for now, please remain calm
and quiet.

78
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:12,382
Just wait for the good news

79
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:13,949
and we'll alert you...

80
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:16,148
as soon as he's here.

81
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,815
I can't take it!

82
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:25,916
He approaches.

83
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:27,148
Or I think.

84
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,615
Master Immortal,
I have something for you...

85
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:32,181
I can't drink now.
That'd be so unprofessional.

86
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:33,615
I'll just leave it here.

87
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:36,048
I have important things to do.
Take it away.

88
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,148
Hey.

89
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,217
Ah, some people
just don't listen.

90
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:46,115
Well, one sip can't hurt!

91
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:47,649
Don't want it going to waste!

92
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:52,482
That's nice.

93
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:55,016
I mean, I'm basically
almost done. So...

94
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:06,018
Enjoy your enchanted
three-day nap!

95
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:09,217
Ah!

96
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,515
I knew it! A spell was cast,

97
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:19,215
so only Taiyi
would be able to move it.

98
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:29,081
Your highness.

99
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,282
The immortal's spell
must be cast soon!

100
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:33,016
Has the time come?

101
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:34,348
What's wrong?

102
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,615
He passed out,
I think he's drunk.

103
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,649
- He's what?
- I guess we'll have to do it

104
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:39,982
the hard way.

105
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:41,148
Now hold on.

106
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,949
We can't just go beating up
on the man.

107
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:44,315
He's an immortal. It's wrong!

108
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:46,715
Milord!
She won't last much longer!

109
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:47,882
Out of the way!

110
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,749
Oh, you wouldn't believe
the crazy dream I just had.

111
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:03,415
I beg you. Open the lotus!

112
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,484
Oh, yeah! I knew
there was something I forgot!

113
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:17,415
Go on! Is something wrong?

114
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:19,916
I can't remember the password.

115
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,749
That was some
crazy strong stuff!

116
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,817
Okay, let's see, uh...

117
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,317
No big deal!
I have four more tries.

118
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:39,048
What the heck?

119
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,582
And if you're wrong
a fifth time?

120
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:41,482
It locks itself

121
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:43,148
and we can try again
in ten years.

122
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,482
Come, out!

123
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:50,615
Milord! The lady has fainted!

124
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:51,782
Oh, I got it!

125
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:53,350
- Don't!
- Is he mad?

126
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:00,048
I just remembered.

127
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,315
If you forget the password,

128
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:03,515
you can just verify
with a handprint.

129
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:08,115
Look over there,
it's happy hour!

130
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:09,350
Huh?

131
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,815
I knew something felt off
with you.

132
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:15,584
Look! A Slave Rune.

133
00:10:16,584 --> 00:10:17,484
Huh?

134
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:22,751
Huh?

135
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:27,682
He's got control of her!

136
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:29,348
You want it so badly?

137
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,916
Okay, I'll give one back.

138
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:33,584
Halt!

139
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:42,882
Oh, boy.

140
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:18,150
Milord! I'm not sure
what happened but...

141
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:22,584
What?

142
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:55,582
Gotcha!

143
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,649
You're not going anywhere,
buddy...

144
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,150
Watch out!

145
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,315
Ah, he's getting away.

146
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:03,949
With the power of sun and moon,
of sea and sand,

147
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,250
Qiankun Hoop, obey my command!

148
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:23,048
Hold!

149
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:30,782
Take this, you little demon!

150
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:31,815
- That's my son!
- No.

151
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:34,016
That's the reincarnation
of the Demon Pill

152
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:34,949
and he's bad news!

153
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:36,916
If he didn't have
the Qiankun Hoop containing him,

154
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:39,649
he'd unleash a reign of terror
like the world's never seen.

155
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,081
Go back where you belong!

156
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,284
No!

157
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:52,083
My love!

158
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,016
Please don't hurt him.

159
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:56,849
Don't hurt my child!

160
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:57,916
But...

161
00:13:57,918 --> 00:13:59,415
Lord Li!

162
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:02,849
For generations
we have battled against demons.

163
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:05,582
Do you think it wise
to endanger our people

164
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:07,916
by letting one live among us?

165
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:10,215
As the leader of Chentang Pass,

166
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,849
I hope you can consider
the greater good

167
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,684
and do what's right.

168
00:14:15,717 --> 00:14:17,081
He's over there.

169
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,782
YOU HAVE A SON!

170
00:14:18,784 --> 00:14:20,382
MY CONDOLENCES

171
00:14:22,284 --> 00:14:23,815
You see that?

172
00:14:23,817 --> 00:14:26,183
I'm here. Don't be scared.

173
00:14:40,717 --> 00:14:43,115
Your Grace. Everyone...

174
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:46,215
My family is unfortunate.
This I know.

175
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:48,348
But my son
is also just a victim

176
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,649
of this misfortune.

177
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:52,582
And I'm not of the mind
to kill an innocent child.

178
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:54,715
I will take care
of Ne Zha's education,

179
00:14:54,717 --> 00:14:57,382
and I promise he won't set foot
in the village.

180
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:59,115
If he brings you any harm,

181
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:01,181
then I will receive
your punishment.

182
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:04,016
I'm willing to pay
the ultimate price.

183
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:06,248
Even if we spare him.

184
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,749
He'll only have three years.

185
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:10,081
The Supreme Lord
put a curse on the Pill

186
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,582
so three years from today,

187
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:14,782
a lightning bolt will strike him
and take his life.

188
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:16,916
Oh.

189
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:19,081
His curse can't be broken.

190
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,448
I'll convince him
to have it removed.

191
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,083
Don't worry. My darling.
I will protect our child.

192
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:21,050
Finally...

193
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:25,982
This is the Spirit Pearl?

194
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:28,815
If I infuse it into an egg...

195
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:33,048
That means my son
will be all-powerful.

196
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,081
Unstoppable.

197
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,048
And my child will become a god?

198
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,215
You'll never...

199
00:16:40,217 --> 00:16:42,551
- Never what?
- Fail, sir!

200
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,817
Oh, very well.

201
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:08,582
This is my son, Ao Bing.

202
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:11,282
As agreed,
I will entrust him to you

203
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:13,181
and he shall call you master.

204
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:15,348
On the condition
you help free him

205
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,549
from this underwater purgatory.

206
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:21,215
And he joins Heaven's Court.

207
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:23,115
- I can't...
- You can't?

208
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:25,749
Can't be defeated.

209
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:27,016
I'm going to prove to you

210
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:30,517
that you've put your trust
in the most worthy immortal.

211
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,515
Next time...

212
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:36,784
Could you do me a favor
and just nod?

213
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:46,382
That right there
is a void portal.

214
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:49,315
The Supreme Lord entered
a realm beyond the three worlds,

215
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:52,083
so this door is the only way
we can get to him.

216
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:57,682
Supreme Lord! It is I!
Your disciple, Taiyi.

217
00:17:57,684 --> 00:18:00,181
Taiyi, do you understand

218
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:01,682
what you've done?

219
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:02,916
Yes, I know I messed up

220
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:05,282
but it's not really my fault
because there was a demon and...

221
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,815
Ah! No excuses!

222
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:09,482
What took you so long to see me?

223
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:12,016
I get so bored by myself.

224
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:13,682
Ah! It's just you.

225
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:14,715
This is Chang ShengYun.

226
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:16,448
He's in charge
of the void portal.

227
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,282
But we just call him
Clingy Cloud.

228
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:20,016
Oh, yeah?
Well, we call you fatty!

229
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:21,248
Hello, new friend.

230
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,849
Not in front of company.
Treat me with some respect!

231
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:25,048
And this is Li Jing,

232
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,382
- Commander of Chengtang Pass.
- A pleasure! Really!

233
00:18:27,384 --> 00:18:29,749
It's a party! I have company!

234
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:33,315
Oh, yes, sit, sit!
Here, have some tea.

235
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:36,115
It's hard sitting here
guarding the gate every day.

236
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:37,582
So what's new with the mortals?

237
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,348
I've been out of the loop
for so long.

238
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,181
Please relay
to the Supreme Lord.

239
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:42,749
We seek an audience with him.

240
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:44,215
Huh? I'm sorry but...

241
00:18:44,217 --> 00:18:47,148
Unfortunately, our master
and some of his god pals

242
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,482
went to the void portal.

243
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:50,515
Probably attending
to godly matters.

244
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,549
But why do you want to see him?
Do tell, do tell.

245
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,382
Someone's under
a heaven-made curse,

246
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,815
and I want him to call it off.

247
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:57,982
Say it ain't so!

248
00:18:57,984 --> 00:18:59,348
Then it's useless
to speak to him.

249
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,982
That curse is unbreakable.

250
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:10,949
One day here is a year there.

251
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,315
Which means back on earth,

252
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,515
a great deal of time
has already passed.

253
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:16,549
We need to head back
as soon as possible.

254
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:18,784
Maybe there's something
we can do for him.

255
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:31,417
These dumb walls
crush my soul.

256
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:35,649
Even prisoners get parole.

257
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:37,782
No friends, no fun,

258
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:40,081
it's just the worst.

259
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,749
Hopefully boredom
will get me first.

260
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:45,615
Ne Zha.
What're you doing up there?

261
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,348
Can't go outside
and nobody will play with me.

262
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,250
So what else can I do
but check out the sights?

263
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:53,715
Then... Oh!

264
00:19:53,717 --> 00:19:55,882
Why don't you describe
the scenery to mommy?

265
00:19:55,884 --> 00:19:58,382
Grass, trees, and dumb flowers.

266
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:00,215
And a guy showing his butt.

267
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:02,215
Oh, you with your jokes.

268
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:04,148
Hey. Why don't I play with you?

269
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,615
Don't mess with me.

270
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:08,016
You don't have more demons
to fight or something?

271
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:11,016
This is the first time
I've seen you in forever.

272
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:13,148
You never have time to play.

273
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,315
I know. I know this is hard.

274
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:18,482
I would love to play more, baby,

275
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,515
however the fortress
needs protecting.

276
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:22,615
I can't be everywhere at once.

277
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:23,515
Uh...

278
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:25,515
But today has been peaceful.

279
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,982
How does playing jianzi
sound to you?

280
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:32,684
Well since you're so bored
I guess I can play with you.

281
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,250
Ready? Go!

282
00:20:46,784 --> 00:20:49,782
Milady. I think you should
put your armor on.

283
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:50,949
You must be joking.

284
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,315
He is my son and we're playing.

285
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,183
Nobody's died from jianzi.

286
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:55,849
Catch...

287
00:20:55,851 --> 00:20:56,916
this!

288
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:58,350
Ready...

289
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,749
Uh, you okay, ma?

290
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,615
I'm fine! I'm fine!

291
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:04,684
Good shot!

292
00:21:05,384 --> 00:21:06,849
On second thought...

293
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:08,415
Did I kick it too hard?

294
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:11,382
No. Kick as hard as you want!

295
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:13,284
You two, join in.

296
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,882
Maybe you should rest.

297
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:29,350
No. I'm alright.

298
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:33,751
Look at how much fun
Ne Zha's having.

299
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:38,582
It's been a long time since
he smiled like that.

300
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:41,551
That's wonderful
for him, milady.

301
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:44,081
Report!

302
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,315
An eel spirit's destroying
the eastern fishing village.

303
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:47,549
We need reinforcements.

304
00:21:47,551 --> 00:21:49,117
Mom, catch!

305
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,348
Sweetie...

306
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,784
We're going to
have to call it a day.

307
00:22:02,918 --> 00:22:04,782
But next time...

308
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:06,916
We can play as long as you want.

309
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,849
I promise.

310
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:10,749
That's what you said last time.

311
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:12,749
It's fine.
I'm used to it by now.

312
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:14,651
I'll cook
your favorite when I come home!

313
00:22:44,117 --> 00:22:45,250
- Huh?
- Huh?

314
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:53,749
And you two.

315
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:55,849
Master Immortal Taiyi
brought you here

316
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:56,749
to protect the barrier,

317
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,749
not so you can
be flashy mascots.

318
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:01,448
Do not allow him
to get out anymore.

319
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,649
Don't worry.
I guarded the southern boundary.

320
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:05,682
And it's his fault
Ne Zha got out last time.

321
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,782
You are so f-full of it!
The north was secured.

322
00:23:08,784 --> 00:23:11,148
He's clearly guilty.
Just look at this guy!

323
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,382
Huh?
You turn that finger around!

324
00:23:13,384 --> 00:23:16,148
Once Taiyi Zhenren returns,
you just wait!

325
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,448
Cause I'm sure
he loves to hear you whine!

326
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,315
That's it! Fight me.
Come on, you wanna go?

327
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,549
- Bring it! I ain't scared!
- Oh, yeah, chicken?

328
00:23:23,551 --> 00:23:25,415
- Chicken? You are!
- Ah!

329
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:27,348
Cut it...

330
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,916
- I'll show you a chicken.
- Who's the chicken?

331
00:23:28,918 --> 00:23:31,181
Chicken says "what?"

332
00:23:31,183 --> 00:23:32,551
- Huh?
- Huh?

333
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:43,715
Huh?

334
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:48,482
Huh? What? Whatcha lookin' at?

335
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:50,150
Huh?

336
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:01,749
What's the big idea...

337
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:06,882
Body Slam!

338
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,248
Dragon Whip!

339
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,882
Crabby Sea Monster!

340
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:15,350
Immortal Picking Grapes!

341
00:24:17,884 --> 00:24:19,348
Come on, Dad!

342
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,417
- One!
- Huh?

343
00:24:24,884 --> 00:24:27,148
Two!

344
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,048
He's out again!

345
00:24:34,217 --> 00:24:36,148
Three!

346
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,150
Four!

347
00:24:40,117 --> 00:24:41,717
Five.

348
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,684
Six!

349
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:48,382
Seven!

350
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,117
Eight.

351
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:52,684
Nine!

352
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:55,584
Ten.

353
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,784
Ready or not...

354
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:36,651
Huh?

355
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:49,782
I've had enough.

356
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:50,715
Let's fight.

357
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:54,115
But boss. There's no way
we can beat Ne Zha.

358
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:55,181
Not true!

359
00:25:55,183 --> 00:25:58,048
Are we, or are we not
The Demonhunters Gang?

360
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,682
Until we can figure out a way...

361
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:01,582
no one goes home!

362
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:03,050
Huh?

363
00:26:06,117 --> 00:26:07,482
I have a way, boss!

364
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:09,649
Huh? I told you to keep guard.

365
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,549
Go back.

366
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:13,117
I was thinking
we could set some traps.

367
00:26:13,951 --> 00:26:15,282
Like what?

368
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,849
Check this out!

369
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:19,215
Ne Zha's gonna
come down that bridge,

370
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:21,048
<i>but he won't know I
cut the ropes...</i>

371
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,181
- <i>And bam!</i>
- Ah!

372
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:23,482
<i>When he hits the ground,</i>

373
00:26:23,484 --> 00:26:24,715
<i>it'll trigger the
second trap,</i>

374
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:27,815
<i>an overhead basket filled
with sharp pointy objects!</i>

375
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:28,949
<i>He'll reach</i>

376
00:26:28,951 --> 00:26:31,315
<i>for the nearest shield,
which will be an old pan.</i>

377
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:32,348
<i>But surprise!</i>

378
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,350
<i>There's another trap
within that trap!</i>

379
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:37,682
<i>He'll run
and run and run...</i>

380
00:26:37,684 --> 00:26:40,248
<i>And "What's that?
A safe space to hide?"</i>

381
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,248
<i>But not so fast...</i>

382
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,248
<i>Lift-off!</i>

383
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,582
<i>Boom!</i>

384
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:47,081
<i>But better watch out...</i>

385
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,982
<i>for that venomous snake!</i>

386
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:52,282
<i>And he'll start climbing the
rope ladder near the tree.</i>

387
00:26:52,284 --> 00:26:53,815
<i>Which should make
all those hornets</i>

388
00:26:53,817 --> 00:26:56,916
in the hornet's nest I put there
<i>really mad.</i>

389
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,382
If he doesn't want
<i>to get stung so bad</i>

390
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,949
his head swells like a balloon,

391
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:03,016
<i>he'll have to jump
into the mud pit.</i>

392
00:27:03,018 --> 00:27:04,882
And when he finally crawls out,

393
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:08,248
<i>he'll be so scared and angrysmoke
will come out of his ears.</i>

394
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,448
Nice! I never noticed
how clever you were.

395
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,682
I'd have to be smart to hang out
with someone like you.

396
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:16,582
You know, when you're right,
you're right.

397
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:18,649
But he needs
something way worse.

398
00:27:18,651 --> 00:27:21,382
I got it, let's add some sea
urchins to the pit!

399
00:27:21,384 --> 00:27:22,549
That'll do the trick.

400
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:24,215
It's important for him
to stay hydrated.

401
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:29,016
Um, guys?
You don't think that's too mean?

402
00:27:29,018 --> 00:27:30,982
Huh? He's mean.

403
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,215
He humiliates us so

404
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,248
- we're just returning the favor.
- Yes.

405
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,081
- Yeah. That's right!
- Yeah. Exactly.

406
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,949
All right. Well you're the boss.

407
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:39,382
Who am I to disagree?

408
00:27:39,384 --> 00:27:42,549
Hold on. I just had
an important thought.

409
00:27:42,551 --> 00:27:44,749
- What is it?
- If our plan starts with Ne Zha

410
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:46,815
on the bridge,
how do we get him there?

411
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:48,248
That part's easy.

412
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,982
We can scare him onto it.

413
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:51,250
- Huh?
- Like how?

414
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:54,215
Like...

415
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,115
You were right about one thing.

416
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,782
It's important to stay hydrated!

417
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:27,916
You guys! You guys!

418
00:28:27,918 --> 00:28:28,949
- He beat me up.
- Huh?

419
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:30,782
And he took all my clothes!

420
00:28:30,784 --> 00:28:33,081
Well fellas, it's been real.

421
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:34,782
You guys are a lot of fun.

422
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:36,782
Yeah? Laugh all you want.

423
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:38,150
You demon!

424
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:43,582
What did you just call me?

425
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:45,248
I said...

426
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:47,284
- you're a demon!
- No!

427
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:13,081
Ne Zha!

428
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,684
That'll be enough of that.

429
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,415
- Boundary Beasts!
- Sir!

430
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:18,515
Tighten the boundary.

431
00:29:18,517 --> 00:29:21,849
He's now prohibited from
setting foot outside this room.

432
00:29:21,851 --> 00:29:23,450
Sir!

433
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:35,317
Enough.

434
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,417
We expected
this might happen one day.

435
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:46,081
We tried but...

436
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,117
maybe this is just his fate.

437
00:29:49,984 --> 00:29:53,582
Even after forbidding them
from mentioning the word demon,

438
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:56,115
people will never see him
as anything but.

439
00:29:56,117 --> 00:29:58,016
And I've been so busy
fighting monsters

440
00:29:58,018 --> 00:30:00,081
to gain goodwill on his behalf.

441
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:03,083
I've neglected my boy.

442
00:30:04,384 --> 00:30:06,517
He only has two years left.

443
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,248
Let's resign our
positions.

444
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,382
Take him to play
in the mountains,

445
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:14,582
and just be with him.

446
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:15,584
Until the end.

447
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:24,315
Uh, Lady Yin? This is on me.

448
00:30:24,317 --> 00:30:26,782
So I've decided to take him on
as an apprentice.

449
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:27,782
I'll shape the Demon Pill

450
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:31,181
into a demon-fighting
warrior of justice.

451
00:30:31,183 --> 00:30:33,982
Is that our only option?

452
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,749
To put him through all that?

453
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,484
Shouldn't we just let him
enjoy the time he's got?

454
00:30:39,918 --> 00:30:42,651
I do not wish to rob him
of a meaningful life.

455
00:30:43,684 --> 00:30:45,148
And would you want this?

456
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,183
For him to be remembered as
a demon?

457
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,215
Master Ne Zha!

458
00:30:56,217 --> 00:30:57,651
Time for breakfast.

459
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:05,081
Huh?

460
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,882
The young Master's
escaped again.

461
00:31:06,884 --> 00:31:08,749
What? Oh, no!

462
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,949
What?

463
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:16,315
- That's impossible.
- Mm-hm.

464
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:17,815
- I agree.
- Don't stand there!

465
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:19,248
Report this to Master Li.

466
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:23,317
- You can count on me!
- I'm on it.

467
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:27,183
There's no guard alive...

468
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:30,617
who can keep me locked up.

469
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:36,584
Huh?

470
00:31:38,817 --> 00:31:40,117
Wha...

471
00:31:42,018 --> 00:31:43,183
Eh?

472
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,284
Woah.

473
00:32:11,018 --> 00:32:11,982
Welcome to the world

474
00:32:11,984 --> 00:32:14,248
inside the painting.
Scenic isn't it?

475
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,382
What's the big id...

476
00:32:15,384 --> 00:32:17,682
Ah-da-da. Hold onto your socks.

477
00:32:17,684 --> 00:32:19,684
I'm about to show you
a little somethin'.

478
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:24,749
With one stroke,
you can change the painting

479
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:27,617
to reflect whatever
your little heart desires!

480
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:30,248
You've got a brush. Big deal!

481
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,582
Why don't you just sit back

482
00:32:31,584 --> 00:32:34,115
and watch this bad boy
in action!

483
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:35,751
Do your thing, brush!

484
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:48,215
No, no, no.

485
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,250
Wow!

486
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:44,183
Young apprentice,
we haven't even started!

487
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:02,150
Wow...

488
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,882
Mighty impressive, huh?

489
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,248
Just think,
you can spend every day here

490
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,682
learning the Immortal magic
of Kunlun with me.

491
00:34:17,684 --> 00:34:20,916
Go ahead. Call me master,
I know you're impressed.

492
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:23,215
Master?

493
00:34:23,217 --> 00:34:24,684
What could I learn from you?

494
00:34:26,183 --> 00:34:30,248
Huh? Why you...
You're in trouble now.

495
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,081
On my command,
one, two, change!

496
00:34:37,384 --> 00:34:38,617
Look out.

497
00:34:40,817 --> 00:34:42,782
Magic'd!

498
00:34:42,784 --> 00:34:44,715
- Huh?
- That's my handy-dandy

499
00:34:44,717 --> 00:34:46,215
disguising spell.

500
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,148
- Wanna learn it?
- Yeah!

501
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,248
This looks yummy.

502
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,549
So can you make me
look all big and scary?

503
00:34:58,551 --> 00:35:00,482
Now what would I go
and do all that for?

504
00:35:00,484 --> 00:35:03,181
Also, that's next-level stuff,
even I can't pull that off.

505
00:35:03,183 --> 00:35:05,115
Don't get fancy,
learn the basics.

506
00:35:05,117 --> 00:35:06,215
Come on little guy.

507
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:07,916
Your master's gonna teach you...

508
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:13,515
That's easy.
Teach me something cooler.

509
00:35:13,517 --> 00:35:15,649
The disguising spell
is the most basic.

510
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:17,817
If you won't learn that
then I won't even bother!

511
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:21,183
Fine. Watch me knock this out.

512
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,417
On my command! Change!

513
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:26,517
Change!

514
00:35:27,517 --> 00:35:28,849
Change!

515
00:35:28,851 --> 00:35:31,949
The disguising spell
isn't even remotely basic.

516
00:35:31,951 --> 00:35:35,515
Took me six whole months
to master my first disguise.

517
00:35:35,517 --> 00:35:38,982
Knock yourself out,
take your time.

518
00:35:38,984 --> 00:35:42,183
AN IMMORTAL PREPARES

519
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:53,148
Master? Master.

520
00:35:56,317 --> 00:35:59,115
Lady Yin. What a nice surprise.

521
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,382
I'm checking on Ne Zha.

522
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,549
I'm just teaching him
some stuff.

523
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:03,615
Where is my son?

524
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:05,217
Oh, right there...

525
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:07,584
Huh?

526
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:10,450
Hang on. What is that?

527
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:14,215
Ah! Hang on, kid.

528
00:36:14,217 --> 00:36:16,083
I'll save you.

529
00:36:29,018 --> 00:36:30,651
Ne Zha. What happened?

530
00:36:31,851 --> 00:36:32,749
What is this?

531
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:36,115
Huh? I didn't do that!
I promise you!

532
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:37,749
How'd this happen?

533
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:39,482
Oh, good, he has a pulse.

534
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:58,582
Oh! Oh, no! It's poisonous.

535
00:37:10,851 --> 00:37:13,849
You should treat me
with more respect.

536
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:16,181
How'd you master that spell
so quickly?

537
00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:18,081
I don't know,
by being super awesome?

538
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,749
Okay, don't get jealous.

539
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:22,949
Even though it took him one day
what took you six months.

540
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:25,081
Share your trick

541
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,315
with your beloved master?

542
00:37:26,317 --> 00:37:29,215
Teach me more Immortal Magic
and I'll tell you.

543
00:37:29,217 --> 00:37:30,782
Yep! You got it, kid!

544
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:34,215
Since your element is fire,
I'll teach you fire control.

545
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:35,815
Tongue of flame. Sands of time.

546
00:37:35,817 --> 00:37:37,782
Unleash heat
from the holy shrine.

547
00:37:37,784 --> 00:37:39,215
Make it so!

548
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:45,849
Not cool, that got in my eye.

549
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:48,815
I can't say this spell right
with my tongue all swollen.

550
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:52,284
Aha! Good thing I have
an anti-venom pill in my pants.

551
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:56,882
Oh, I can't reach it.

552
00:37:56,884 --> 00:37:59,782
Can you get it for me,
little guy, please?

553
00:37:59,784 --> 00:38:01,582
No problem.

554
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:05,615
Whoa! You've got
like treasure pants!

555
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,081
Huh? What's this
weird moppy thingy?

556
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,448
It's for flies.

557
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,248
What?
What about this shiny thing?

558
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,016
That's a fire-tipped spear.

559
00:38:15,018 --> 00:38:17,348
A fire-tipped spear,
huh?

560
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,248
Hey, don't touch that switch.

561
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,982
You mean this switch?

562
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:26,584
Huh? Ha?

563
00:38:34,717 --> 00:38:37,317
Ne Zha!
Are you causing trouble again?

564
00:38:43,284 --> 00:38:45,448
Your grace! Are you all right?

565
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,584
I'm an immortal,
I can't get hurt, but thanks.

566
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:51,949
Ne Zha. If you show me respect,

567
00:38:51,951 --> 00:38:53,282
the things I'll teach you...

568
00:38:53,284 --> 00:38:55,682
Like banishing demons
and defeating monsters.

569
00:38:55,684 --> 00:38:59,215
What? Banish demons?
And defeat monsters?

570
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:02,282
Nice try! Like I'd ever
learn anything from you.

571
00:39:02,284 --> 00:39:03,682
How do I get out of here?

572
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:06,215
Well you'll have to use
this little landscape brush,

573
00:39:06,217 --> 00:39:08,315
if you wish to escape
from the painting.

574
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:09,749
Oh, wait a minute.

575
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:12,016
You want to keep me
locked up in here.

576
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:13,315
No don't be silly.

577
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,982
A place this lovely
could never be a prison, dear.

578
00:39:15,984 --> 00:39:17,615
It's a "training retreat."

579
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:20,248
So I train
and they'd still hate me anyway.

580
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,551
I'd be better off
just taking a nap.

581
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:27,549
Ne Zha.
I'm your mother.

582
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:31,448
I know you. I know you want
the others to accept you.

583
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,148
But you feel more and more alone
every time they rejected you.

584
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,115
And you resent them for that.

585
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:41,315
Young master?

586
00:39:41,317 --> 00:39:45,551
How did he get out again?
Young master?

587
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,384
Huh?

588
00:39:52,217 --> 00:39:54,384
Hi, you wanna play?

589
00:39:56,517 --> 00:39:57,615
Mm-hm!

590
00:39:58,951 --> 00:40:01,181
Ne Zha!

591
00:40:01,183 --> 00:40:02,582
I thought he was locked away!

592
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:05,882
- They let him out!
- Everyone run!

593
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:17,215
Go back to where you came from!

594
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:19,081
- Yeah!
- Little demon brat!

595
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,916
- No one likes you!
- You're a Demon!

596
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,382
Yeah, no one wants you here!

597
00:40:22,384 --> 00:40:23,484
Go away!

598
00:40:28,284 --> 00:40:31,215
You've been through a lot,
but it will be alright.

599
00:40:31,217 --> 00:40:34,248
After your training you'll
be able to banish demons

600
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,081
with us and earn
their admiration.

601
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,448
Why would I do anything
for them? Never!

602
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,982
They wanna see me as a demon?

603
00:40:40,984 --> 00:40:43,183
I'll show them what a demon
really looks like!

604
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:45,448
Dear, you...

605
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:51,549
I guess it's time
we tell you the truth.

606
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:54,217
The secret we've kept
for so long.

607
00:40:55,684 --> 00:40:57,549
Why they're so afraid.

608
00:40:57,551 --> 00:41:00,615
You are actually...

609
00:41:00,617 --> 00:41:02,551
The Spirit, what?

610
00:41:03,984 --> 00:41:05,248
Oh. Right, right. Right!

611
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,949
The reincarnation!

612
00:41:06,951 --> 00:41:09,817
And it's that divine strength
they find so intimidating.

613
00:41:11,018 --> 00:41:13,048
Are you... lying?

614
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,582
Use your head.

615
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:17,415
Your father and I are humans.

616
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:19,415
How could we give birth
to a demon?

617
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:22,348
Then, why don't you just
tell them I'm the Spirit Pearl?

618
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,448
The Spirit Pearl
was a secret weapon

619
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,982
the Supreme Lord sent down
to the mortal realm.

620
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,181
It's not called an "everyone
knows about it" weapon.

621
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:32,250
They couldn't
handle the truth.

622
00:41:32,851 --> 00:41:35,215
The truth...

623
00:41:35,217 --> 00:41:37,415
In the meantime,
try to win their hearts.

624
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:39,048
Treat them as if they're family.

625
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,382
Keep them safe from harm,

626
00:41:40,384 --> 00:41:42,215
and they'll surely
return the favor,

627
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:44,450
embracing you
as one of their own.

628
00:41:50,951 --> 00:41:53,083
TWO YEARS LATER

629
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:13,682
Total piece of cake.

630
00:42:18,717 --> 00:42:22,150
No, no, no.
Way too impulsive.

631
00:42:27,617 --> 00:42:28,651
Show him, go on.

632
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:52,183
Stop there.

633
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:54,782
Yummy human!

634
00:42:57,817 --> 00:42:58,817
<i>See here?</i>

635
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:05,651
<i>And here too.</i>

636
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:13,615
Look at that. You harmed
all those innocent civilians,

637
00:43:13,617 --> 00:43:15,515
just to destroy
a couple skeletons.

638
00:43:15,517 --> 00:43:17,215
Yeah, they're
not even real though.

639
00:43:17,217 --> 00:43:18,715
What's the big deal.

640
00:43:18,717 --> 00:43:21,081
If you can't do the right thing
in training,

641
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:23,048
how can we trust you
in the real world.

642
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:26,348
Your Grace, take away
his Chaotic Silk and spear.

643
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:28,215
Until he learns self-control,

644
00:43:28,217 --> 00:43:29,715
he's banned from
such powerful weapons.

645
00:43:29,717 --> 00:43:33,115
Fine, so take it back.
See if I care!

646
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:34,415
I've learned
all your Immortal Magic,

647
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:36,081
so I can go kick demon butt.

648
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:37,181
No way.

649
00:43:37,183 --> 00:43:39,315
In fact, from now on
your only focus

650
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:41,048
will be meditation not fighting.

651
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:44,048
What? You wanted me to learn
how to fight monsters.

652
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,315
Well I did that!

653
00:43:45,317 --> 00:43:47,348
Oh, why won't you
let me out of here?

654
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,450
You're not leaving here
'til I say so.

655
00:43:52,217 --> 00:43:53,549
Yeah, whatever.

656
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:55,649
I'd like to see you
try and stop me.

657
00:43:55,651 --> 00:43:57,350
- Huh, how'd he get that?
- Ne Zha!

658
00:43:58,384 --> 00:43:59,949
Don't worry, I got this!

659
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:01,450
They're gonna love me!

660
00:44:45,284 --> 00:44:47,682
I'm so sick of seafood.

661
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:49,982
But it's good
to change things up.

662
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:53,916
Yo, demon!

663
00:44:53,918 --> 00:44:55,515
Let go of that dog!

664
00:44:55,517 --> 00:44:57,181
Huh?

665
00:44:57,183 --> 00:44:59,048
Huh?

666
00:45:01,484 --> 00:45:04,016
What, you want me
to eat you instead?

667
00:45:04,018 --> 00:45:05,217
Right here!

668
00:45:07,684 --> 00:45:09,551
Why...

669
00:45:12,183 --> 00:45:13,715
Huh?

670
00:45:13,717 --> 00:45:14,584
- Huh?
- Huh?

671
00:45:25,117 --> 00:45:26,517
Oh, no, you don't!

672
00:45:47,217 --> 00:45:49,250
Huh?

673
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,749
Get out here!

674
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:54,382
Show your face!

675
00:45:56,817 --> 00:45:58,215
Stop!

676
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:00,081
Turn around and watch this!

677
00:46:01,684 --> 00:46:05,016
Come out! Stop hiding!

678
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:08,215
Be like that.

679
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:10,649
Guess I'll have
to smoke you out!

680
00:46:16,217 --> 00:46:18,450
- How horrible!
- Ne Zha's gone mad!

681
00:46:25,384 --> 00:46:27,517
Hey!
Where you think you're goin'?

682
00:46:37,884 --> 00:46:39,482
Ready? It's coming!

683
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,517
Huh?

684
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,484
Ne Zha kidnapped Yaya!

685
00:47:04,717 --> 00:47:08,181
Good luck catching me
in the sea, puny human!

686
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:18,382
I've frozen the sea
for half a kilometer.

687
00:47:18,384 --> 00:47:20,150
You can't escape.

688
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,348
Demon, let the girl go.

689
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,482
Why should I listen to you?

690
00:47:28,484 --> 00:47:31,815
Stay back, child.
I'm here to save her.

691
00:47:31,817 --> 00:47:33,248
I'm not a child!

692
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,751
You should surrender.

693
00:47:48,751 --> 00:47:50,048
Wrong choice.

694
00:47:53,851 --> 00:47:55,815
Back off
and get in line, weirdo!

695
00:47:55,817 --> 00:47:56,782
I saw this guy first!

696
00:47:56,784 --> 00:47:59,282
What... what on earth
are you doing?

697
00:47:59,284 --> 00:48:01,115
Huh?

698
00:48:01,117 --> 00:48:03,115
Wait your turn!
I'll kick your butt next!

699
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:05,417
Where are you paren...

700
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:12,050
Town's only big enough
for one cool guy.

701
00:48:13,117 --> 00:48:15,217
- Hey, demon! Let that girl go!
- Huh?

702
00:48:18,217 --> 00:48:20,181
There's something
different about you.

703
00:48:20,183 --> 00:48:21,417
Whatever!

704
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:37,815
Ow, let go! I said let go!

705
00:48:42,517 --> 00:48:44,682
Huh? Woah, you have horns!

706
00:48:44,684 --> 00:48:46,250
Huh.

707
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:16,250
Huh, bubbles?

708
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:20,315
What's goin' on?

709
00:49:20,317 --> 00:49:23,482
Take a good look around you.

710
00:49:23,484 --> 00:49:26,115
I should thank you both
for giving me time

711
00:49:26,117 --> 00:49:28,248
to unleash my special attack.

712
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,081
Go on, make a move.

713
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,615
Not so tough now, huh?

714
00:49:31,617 --> 00:49:33,582
I can finally have my dinner
in peace.

715
00:49:35,951 --> 00:49:38,582
Hey, spit her out!

716
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:40,817
When I get done with you,
you'll wish that you...

717
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:53,181
You don't look so good.

718
00:49:53,183 --> 00:49:55,315
Uh-oh, my spit gotcha!

719
00:49:55,317 --> 00:49:58,183
Seems like you hit
"rock bottom".

720
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:02,348
Maybe in your next life

721
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:05,916
you'll learn
to mind your own business.

722
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:12,217
Huh?

723
00:50:26,384 --> 00:50:28,651
Bring it on, kid!

724
00:50:55,651 --> 00:50:57,048
Please have mercy!

725
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,048
I'll give you the antidote!

726
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:00,150
Antidote?

727
00:51:05,951 --> 00:51:08,215
Don't worry. It's enough.

728
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,817
It tastes like garlic!

729
00:51:21,517 --> 00:51:24,282
Huh? Look at that!

730
00:51:24,284 --> 00:51:26,649
How'll they drink?
Their mouths can't move!

731
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:30,115
Uh, you can also apply it
to the skin.

732
00:51:33,018 --> 00:51:35,215
Why didn't you say so?

733
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,284
Well, because you didn't ask.

734
00:51:40,651 --> 00:51:43,649
That's right,
spread it evenly.

735
00:51:43,651 --> 00:51:46,348
You have to
really massage it in.

736
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,415
The skin'll absorb it faster.

737
00:51:48,417 --> 00:51:51,250
Plus, it makes the complexion
all dewy!

738
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,215
- Wait.
- Huh?

739
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:17,782
Spare me.

740
00:52:17,784 --> 00:52:19,982
I just wanted a snack.

741
00:52:19,984 --> 00:52:21,515
I didn't eat a person.

742
00:52:21,517 --> 00:52:24,282
You gave us the antidote.
So I'm grateful.

743
00:52:24,284 --> 00:52:26,849
But if you try to do evil
in the future,

744
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:28,215
I won't spare you again.

745
00:52:28,217 --> 00:52:30,350
Okay, okay.

746
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:33,849
Hey, you! Boy!

747
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:35,181
What? Still wanna fight?

748
00:52:35,183 --> 00:52:36,282
That's not fair to you.

749
00:52:36,284 --> 00:52:38,682
Huh? I'm no match for you?

750
00:52:38,684 --> 00:52:40,582
Come on then.
Show me what you got.

751
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:42,482
- Thank you for saving me.
- Huh?

752
00:52:42,484 --> 00:52:44,882
And for saving
this girl as well.

753
00:52:44,884 --> 00:52:46,582
Today you were my ally.

754
00:52:46,584 --> 00:52:49,215
I will find a way to repay
the kindness you've shown.

755
00:52:49,217 --> 00:52:51,215
Nah, it was nothin'.

756
00:52:51,217 --> 00:52:53,749
I was simply following
the will of Heaven.

757
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:57,284
Cause I was destined
to be a great demon slayer!

758
00:53:00,984 --> 00:53:03,549
You're not afraid of me?

759
00:53:03,551 --> 00:53:06,517
You save Yaya from bad guy.

760
00:53:33,851 --> 00:53:35,684
Hm. Huh?

761
00:54:20,717 --> 00:54:22,515
Hey. What's wrong?

762
00:54:22,517 --> 00:54:25,682
It's nothing.
Just got eyes in my sand.

763
00:54:25,684 --> 00:54:27,649
You mean sand
in your eyes?

764
00:54:27,651 --> 00:54:30,284
Let me see.
I can get it out for you.

765
00:54:33,284 --> 00:54:36,551
Aw man! This is so embarrassing!

766
00:54:37,951 --> 00:54:38,849
Okay, fine!

767
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:41,282
My mom's the only other person
who'll play this with me.

768
00:54:41,284 --> 00:54:43,450
So I got emotional. Big deal!

769
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:50,115
Huh?

770
00:54:50,117 --> 00:54:51,515
We're friends now.

771
00:54:51,517 --> 00:54:54,148
If you want to play again,
come to the shore and blow this.

772
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:57,448
When I hear the conch shell,
I'll come from wherever I am.

773
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,415
I forgot. I'm Ao Bing.

774
00:54:59,417 --> 00:55:00,682
And you?

775
00:55:00,684 --> 00:55:02,384
My name's Ne Zha!

776
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,382
Your friends?

777
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:06,882
What?

778
00:55:08,384 --> 00:55:10,083
- There she is!
- He's here!

779
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:13,083
Huh?

780
00:55:18,584 --> 00:55:20,615
There's Ne Zha.
He kidnapped Yaya!

781
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:21,882
The demon!

782
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:23,815
My baby! Oh, Yaya!

783
00:55:23,817 --> 00:55:25,115
Yaya! How are you feeling?

784
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:27,382
Ne Zha hit. Pow, pow, pow!

785
00:55:27,384 --> 00:55:29,549
Demon go, boom, boom!

786
00:55:29,551 --> 00:55:31,448
Why would you kidnap
a little girl!?

787
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:32,649
That's not what happened!

788
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:34,315
If I hadn't
chased that thing down,

789
00:55:34,317 --> 00:55:36,081
she would've been
demon-food already.

790
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,248
So where's the demon then?
Did you see one?

791
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,348
How about you?

792
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,949
Do you seriously think
we're that dumb?

793
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:42,148
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

794
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,784
You won't get away with this!

795
00:55:47,117 --> 00:55:50,183
Okay, I see.

796
00:55:52,317 --> 00:55:55,050
Go away, you demon brat!

797
00:56:00,984 --> 00:56:02,551
You wanna say that again?

798
00:56:03,183 --> 00:56:04,617
Stop it!

799
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:14,482
See? He's a monster!

800
00:56:14,484 --> 00:56:16,551
- We'll kill you!
- Die, demon!

801
00:56:45,284 --> 00:56:47,248
Your master has arrived.

802
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,815
Stop hurting people.

803
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,484
Ne Zha.

804
00:56:56,417 --> 00:56:57,949
Commander Li!

805
00:56:57,951 --> 00:57:01,048
Ne Zha burned down the village,
kidnapped a child,

806
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,782
and attacked the villagers.

807
00:57:02,784 --> 00:57:04,949
We demand he be punished.

808
00:57:04,951 --> 00:57:08,582
My crimes? I'm gonna show you
a real crime!

809
00:57:08,584 --> 00:57:09,584
Ne Zha, don't.

810
00:57:19,183 --> 00:57:23,181
Lord Li, you must lock
this demon-child up.

811
00:57:23,183 --> 00:57:25,415
Never again to see
the light of day.

812
00:57:25,417 --> 00:57:27,549
Lock him up!
And throw away the key!

813
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,348
Lord Li,

814
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:31,248
you must get your son
under control!

815
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,181
We'd thank you!

816
00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:38,248
He's destroying everything!

817
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,784
It's not safe!

818
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:52,282
Father... Master.

819
00:57:52,284 --> 00:57:55,715
How did today's assignment go?

820
00:57:55,717 --> 00:57:58,849
I made seven lesser revolutions
and four greater ones.

821
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:01,715
I learned to ice over rivers
and create frost and snow.

822
00:58:01,717 --> 00:58:04,284
I've reached the seventh heaven
of the Ice Jade.

823
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,882
Also... I made a friend.

824
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:09,682
I met him near the seashore.

825
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:11,782
Wha... what do you
mean a friend?

826
00:58:11,784 --> 00:58:14,382
You can't reveal your identity.

827
00:58:14,384 --> 00:58:16,882
He was a human,
but he didn't care what I was.

828
00:58:16,884 --> 00:58:19,315
- Because I'm his friend.
- And who was this person?

829
00:58:19,317 --> 00:58:21,882
His name was... Ne Zha.

830
00:58:21,884 --> 00:58:24,649
Huh?

831
00:58:24,651 --> 00:58:29,181
Sma... small world, apprentice.

832
00:58:29,183 --> 00:58:31,982
Sounds like you just met
the Demon Pill.

833
00:58:31,984 --> 00:58:33,715
- Oh, no.
- Ne Zha...

834
00:58:33,717 --> 00:58:36,248
is your sworn rival.

835
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:38,482
We've waited
three whole years.

836
00:58:38,484 --> 00:58:40,382
On the day the reckoning occurs,

837
00:58:40,384 --> 00:58:43,482
the Demon Pill will begin
a mama... massacre...

838
00:58:43,484 --> 00:58:45,916
and then you will rescue
Chentang Pass

839
00:58:45,918 --> 00:58:50,382
and claim your birthright
as the Spirit Pearl.

840
00:58:50,384 --> 00:58:53,615
Master, might he be granted
redemption?

841
00:58:54,951 --> 00:58:57,382
In the times of antiquity,

842
00:58:57,384 --> 00:59:00,649
we dragons
were all-powerful beings,

843
00:59:00,651 --> 00:59:02,849
revered and worshipped.

844
00:59:02,851 --> 00:59:06,315
On behalf of Heaven,
we fought monsters,

845
00:59:06,317 --> 00:59:08,382
subduing them in the ocean,

846
00:59:08,384 --> 00:59:11,916
earning us
the title of Dragon Kings.

847
00:59:11,918 --> 00:59:13,815
Do you understand

848
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:15,982
what this place really is?

849
00:59:15,984 --> 00:59:17,282
Our Palace, right?

850
00:59:17,284 --> 00:59:20,016
Beneath the magma
of this volcano

851
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:24,448
are the countless creatures
we defeated those many years ago

852
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:27,684
at the request
of the Supreme Lord.

853
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:32,549
"Dragon Palace"?

854
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:37,617
It's as much our prison
as it is theirs.

855
00:59:39,851 --> 00:59:42,081
If we were to leave this place,

856
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:46,181
the monsters would break free of
their imprisonment and escape.

857
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:48,382
Do you see now, son?

858
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:52,817
They tricked us into
doing their dirty work for them.

859
00:59:53,884 --> 00:59:55,348
After all.

860
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,148
What were we to Heaven

861
00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:01,849
other than just monsters
to be locked away.

862
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:04,715
The title "King" they gave us?

863
01:00:04,717 --> 01:00:08,148
It's laughable.
I am nothing more than

864
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:10,916
another prisoner in this pit.

865
01:00:10,918 --> 01:00:15,549
We sealed our fate the moment
we took them at their word.

866
01:00:15,551 --> 01:00:19,348
So, my boy,
for the past millennium,

867
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:23,849
the Spirit Pearl has been
our only hope for freedom.

868
01:00:23,851 --> 01:00:25,482
In one year's time,

869
01:00:25,484 --> 01:00:28,849
I'll be able to completely
remove the horns on your head

870
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:32,115
and hide your identity
as a dada... dragon.

871
01:00:32,117 --> 01:00:34,882
If you're victorious
on the day of reckoning.

872
01:00:34,884 --> 01:00:38,682
Then and only then will you
win a place in Heaven,

873
01:00:38,684 --> 01:00:41,048
and be able
to break the dragons free

874
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:44,282
of this underwater purgatory.

875
01:00:44,284 --> 01:00:48,916
Our fate rests entirely
on your shoulders.

876
01:00:48,918 --> 01:00:51,282
Don't let yourself be fooled

877
01:00:51,284 --> 01:00:54,150
by the illusion of friendship.

Dear. How long are you going
to be like this?

888
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:42,382
Leave me alone.

889
01:01:42,384 --> 01:01:45,016

899
01:02:09,884 --> 01:02:12,882
Hey! Your third birthday's
only ten days away.

900
01:02:12,884 --> 01:02:16,016
The people of Chentang Pass
want to celebrate with you.

901
01:02:16,018 --> 01:02:17,117
Yeah?

902
01:02:19,817 --> 01:02:23,517
They'd celebrate my funeral.
Not my birthday.

903
01:02:27,117 --> 01:02:29,215
The Sea Yaksha
can move as water,

904
01:02:29,217 --> 01:02:30,615
without being noticed.

905
01:02:30,617 --> 01:02:34,482
It's saliva can petrify people
and leaves a residue.

906
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:37,448
That misunderstanding
has been resolved.

907
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:39,549
They know you drove off
the demon.

908
01:02:39,551 --> 01:02:41,081
Oh! Yes, your father's right.

909
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:44,250
The celebration's the thank you
for defeating that monster.

910
01:02:44,918 --> 01:02:46,215
It would be.

911
01:02:46,217 --> 01:02:47,982
I see my teachings
have paid off!

912
01:02:47,984 --> 01:02:50,183
Now those morons get it.

913
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:52,749
About time.

914
01:02:52,751 --> 01:02:55,217
- Promise you'll be there?
- All right, fine!

915
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,417
Why did you lie
about his birthday?

916
01:03:20,484 --> 01:03:23,181
Believing he's the Spirit Pearl

917
01:03:23,183 --> 01:03:25,348
has given him joy.

918
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:27,115
If it means
he can stay that way,

919
01:03:27,117 --> 01:03:28,849
then yes, I'm going to lie.

920
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,282
Well, except...

921
01:03:30,284 --> 01:03:33,181
the villagers were clear
they want to lock him up.

922
01:03:33,183 --> 01:03:34,684
Why would they attend his party?

923
01:03:37,384 --> 01:03:39,081
Let me
handle the details.

924
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:40,615
On the beach that day,

925
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:43,016
I saw the Yaksha slime
on his hands.

926
01:03:43,018 --> 01:03:44,882
He was telling the truth.

927
01:03:44,884 --> 01:03:47,081
And I will see to it
that they all learn that,

928
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:48,649
at the celebration.

929
01:03:48,651 --> 01:03:49,849
But...

930
01:03:49,851 --> 01:03:53,016
When you've been commander
as long as I have,

931
01:03:53,018 --> 01:03:54,949
many people owe you favors.

932
01:03:54,951 --> 01:03:58,749
I'll get them all to attend.
You can count on that.

933
01:03:58,751 --> 01:03:59,717
Don't worry.

934
01:04:22,284 --> 01:04:23,482
What do you want?

935
01:04:25,217 --> 01:04:27,083
Ah, don't scare me like that.

936
01:04:28,117 --> 01:04:30,081
My birthday party's in ten days.

937
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,183
And everyone in the Pass
is gonna be there.

938
01:04:33,584 --> 01:04:36,551
I, uh, drew you a map
so you wouldn't get lost.

939
01:04:38,884 --> 01:04:40,148
Li Manor's renowned.

940
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:42,515
I guess.
But you're coming, aren't ya?

941
01:04:42,517 --> 01:04:44,482
- Well...
- Oh, come on!

942
01:04:44,484 --> 01:04:47,217
I don't care if they don't come
but you gotta be there!

943
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:48,715
Why's that?

944
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:50,617
Maybe 'cause
you're my only friend.

945
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:56,217
You're my only friend, too.

946
01:04:57,517 --> 01:04:59,749
Do you have any other wishes?

947
01:04:59,751 --> 01:05:00,715
You saved my life.

948
01:05:00,717 --> 01:05:03,551
So I'll do everything I can
to make them come true.

949
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:06,649
Wishes? Eh, like I said!

950
01:05:06,651 --> 01:05:08,551
My wish is you'd come
to my party!

951
01:05:10,684 --> 01:05:11,849
I'll go.

952
01:05:11,851 --> 01:05:13,484
It's a deal! See you there!

953
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,415
Don't bail!

954
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,384
I won't.

955
01:05:37,551 --> 01:05:38,982
Ao Bing,

956
01:05:38,984 --> 01:05:41,982
It's time to go.

957
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:43,717
One more thing.

958
01:05:50,884 --> 01:05:52,217
Father!

959
01:05:59,717 --> 01:06:01,250
Wait, what're you...

960
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,682
My son...

961
01:06:29,684 --> 01:06:32,315
Each of the dragons
has given you

962
01:06:32,317 --> 01:06:35,682
their hardest scale
for protection.

963
01:06:35,684 --> 01:06:39,315
Dragonscale armor
is impenetrable.

964
01:06:39,317 --> 01:06:42,350
It's all up to you now.

965
01:07:02,317 --> 01:07:04,181
Huh? Why're you so sad?

966
01:07:04,183 --> 01:07:07,284
Show enthusiasm. Smile.

967
01:07:11,651 --> 01:07:13,348
Why does it sound
like a funeral?

968
01:07:20,217 --> 01:07:22,016
When does Lord Li
want us to come out?

969
01:07:22,018 --> 01:07:23,415
He'll signal.

970
01:07:23,417 --> 01:07:24,717
Oh.

971
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:33,016
Hmm.
Yeah, I'm feelin' this cape.

972
01:07:33,018 --> 01:07:36,148
Fancy!

973
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:38,949
A good shroud
for a corpse maybe.

974
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:40,415
What?

975
01:07:40,417 --> 01:07:42,715
I am your ma-mast...

976
01:07:42,717 --> 01:07:45,048
Ew, gross, a demon!

977
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:46,081
Stop!

978
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:47,882
I know your master!

979
01:07:47,884 --> 01:07:50,382
So I'm a friend to you!

980
01:07:50,384 --> 01:07:53,615
Oh. Your name is
Shen something, right?

981
01:07:53,617 --> 01:07:55,715
Shen Go-go-go...

982
01:07:55,717 --> 01:07:56,982
What up, Shen Gonggong?

983
01:07:56,984 --> 01:08:00,549
Brat. It's Shen Go-go-gong-bao!

984
01:08:00,551 --> 01:08:04,282
And I'm here to reveal
your true identity.

985
01:08:04,284 --> 01:08:07,649
What do you mean "true"?

986
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:09,815
Oh, my poor child.

987
01:08:09,817 --> 01:08:13,617
You have been kept in the dark
for far too long.

988
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:21,715
And now let's bring out
the birthday boy!

989
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:34,148
Play with me!

990
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,651
Huh?

991
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:43,315
Today is your birthday,
young apprentice.

992
01:08:43,317 --> 01:08:46,715
And let me tell you
I'm gonna spoil you rotten!

993
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:02,215
Your fire-tipped spear
and Chaotic Silk.

994
01:09:02,217 --> 01:09:04,649
They're officially yours now.

995
01:09:04,651 --> 01:09:06,817
And here's the big one!

996
01:09:09,384 --> 01:09:12,615
This shall serve
as your noble steed.

997
01:09:12,617 --> 01:09:14,284
Go on, touch it.

998
01:09:25,717 --> 01:09:28,248
This guy's
my most prized possession.

999
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:30,148
It can transform
into various mounts

1000
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:31,749
based on the traits
of its owners.

1001
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,882
With you, it will take the form
of a flaming chariot!

1002
01:09:36,617 --> 01:09:39,549
So why does it turn into a pig
with you then?

1003
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:40,617
Huh?

1004
01:09:49,617 --> 01:09:52,181
You stinker.
Where has the time gone?

1005
01:09:52,183 --> 01:09:53,348
Just three years ago,

1006
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:55,515
you were a little meatball
in my belly.

1007
01:09:55,517 --> 01:09:58,684
And now you've become a man
with a personality and...

1008
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:02,817
I so want to watch you grow up.

1009
01:10:08,784 --> 01:10:10,916
Why are you talking like that

1010
01:10:10,918 --> 01:10:12,582
on his birthday?

1011
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:15,551
Dad got you a protection charm
to keep you safe.

1012
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:18,982
I know I've always been
hard on you,

1013
01:10:18,984 --> 01:10:20,649
and you're angry about that.

1014
01:10:20,651 --> 01:10:23,682
But I was doing
what I thought best.

1015
01:10:23,684 --> 01:10:26,482
Now son, you have
a long life ahead.

1016
01:10:26,484 --> 01:10:29,048
Do not pay any attention
to what the others say.

1017
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:31,050
You are who you say you are.

1018
01:10:31,784 --> 01:10:33,284
That's all that matters.

1019
01:10:34,384 --> 01:10:36,448
I believed you.

1020
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:38,515
But all you've done
was lie to me.

1021
01:10:38,517 --> 01:10:40,749
Why are you saying that?

1022
01:10:40,751 --> 01:10:43,749
Come on. The Demon Pill?

1023
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:45,484
I know about everything.

1024
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:48,482
You said I was the Spirit Pearl.

1025
01:10:48,484 --> 01:10:50,649
Put me through training
in the painting.

1026
01:10:50,651 --> 01:10:52,181
But really you were just

1027
01:10:52,183 --> 01:10:54,148
keeping me locked up
until I died.

1028
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:55,982
All to make these idiots happy!

1029
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:59,350
To keep your dumb reputation,
you locked me away!

1030
01:11:00,817 --> 01:11:02,849
Now you're being silly.

1031
01:11:02,851 --> 01:11:04,315
Don't be so dramatic.

1032
01:11:04,317 --> 01:11:06,048
I mean,
look at all these people!

1033
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:08,615
Eating, drinking, being merry.

1034
01:11:10,018 --> 01:11:11,715
Why am I not surprised?

1035
01:11:11,717 --> 01:11:14,949
Fine. If you wanna
keep lying too.

1036
01:11:14,951 --> 01:11:17,415
With the power of sun and moon

1037
01:11:17,417 --> 01:11:19,482
- of sea and sand...
- Where did you learn that spell?

1038
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:22,784
Qiankun Hoop, obey my command!

1039
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:51,384
Run away!

1040
01:11:55,150 --> 01:11:56,282
Finally...

1041
01:11:56,284 --> 01:11:59,317
It's just you and me demon!

1042
01:12:34,484 --> 01:12:37,448
Ne Zha! Stop this!

1043
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:38,682
He's been possessed!

1044
01:12:38,684 --> 01:12:41,248
The Qiankun Hoop
is our only hope!

1045
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,551
Find the hoop!

1046
01:12:44,417 --> 01:12:47,181
Looking for this?

1047
01:12:47,183 --> 01:12:50,815
Don't waste your time.

1048
01:12:50,817 --> 01:12:55,282
Only the heavenly calamity
can stop the Demon Pill.

1049
01:12:55,284 --> 01:12:58,048
Once he's killed Taiyi
and his parents,

1050
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:00,048
go subdue Ne Zha.

1051
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:02,248
Until the lightning
destroys him.

1052
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,815
And when the dust clears,

1053
01:13:03,817 --> 01:13:06,115
the villagers will see you
as a hero.

1054
01:13:06,117 --> 01:13:10,348
After all that, the Supreme Lord
will turn you into a god.

1055
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:12,684
Your power will be limitless.

1056
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:16,448
Ne Zha's parents and Taiyi.

1057
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:18,549
They are all innocent.

1058
01:13:18,551 --> 01:13:20,916
It's not right.
If the hoop was still on,

1059
01:13:20,918 --> 01:13:22,248
then Ne Zha wouldn't be evil.

1060
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,615
What do you care
if he's good or evil?

1061
01:13:24,617 --> 01:13:27,515
He's about to get struck
by lightning!

1062
01:13:27,517 --> 01:13:30,715
If Taiyi and his parents survive

1063
01:13:30,717 --> 01:13:33,784
how will I sell our lie
to the Supreme Lord?

1064
01:13:39,417 --> 01:13:42,549
Fortune didn't smile upon me
when I was born.

1065
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:45,482
I had to fight an uphill battle
to get this far.

1066
01:13:45,484 --> 01:13:48,815
Of all the disciples, I trained
the hardest,

1067
01:13:48,817 --> 01:13:50,282
never slacking.

1068
01:13:50,284 --> 01:13:53,849
Yet continually I was passed
over for the others.

1069
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:56,784
Do... Do you know why, my child?

1070
01:13:57,751 --> 01:13:58,949
No, master.

1071
01:13:58,951 --> 01:14:02,615
Because he knows I was born
a lowly jaguar spirit.

1072
01:14:02,617 --> 01:14:06,715
So he could care less
if I lived or died!

1073
01:14:06,717 --> 01:14:10,849
To everyone else,
you and I are just monsters.

1074
01:14:10,851 --> 01:14:13,715
They could construct
an entire mountain

1075
01:14:13,717 --> 01:14:14,749
with their prejudice.

1076
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:18,649
And no matter how hard you try,
that mountain is immovable.

1077
01:14:18,651 --> 01:14:20,916
But you're being handed
a rare chance

1078
01:14:20,918 --> 01:14:22,815
to change their minds.

1079
01:14:22,817 --> 01:14:25,248
To alter your fate.

1080
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:28,115
- Master. I owe Ne Zha my life.
- Huh?

1081
01:14:28,117 --> 01:14:29,515
Maybe I can't save him

1082
01:14:29,517 --> 01:14:32,215
but let me save his parents
and his master,

1083
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:34,016
to repay my debt.

1084
01:14:34,018 --> 01:14:36,048
Go.

1085
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:37,849
Huh?

1086
01:14:37,851 --> 01:14:40,448
Go on, then.

1087
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:44,515
But if, if,
if this goes south...

1088
01:14:44,517 --> 01:14:47,148
don't say I didn't warn you boy.

1089
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:51,882
If they discover what you are...

1090
01:14:51,884 --> 01:14:56,248
Then I promise more than four
will meet their fate today...

1091
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:59,248
Uh... Hey. I was talking!

1092
01:15:03,617 --> 01:15:05,117
Nope!

1093
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:15,417
Huh?

1094
01:15:39,918 --> 01:15:41,982
Stop! That's your father.

1095
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:00,384
Ah, he's so cool.

1096
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:29,549
Hear that?
We're missing the whole party.

1097
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:31,016
Are you sure we can't go out?

1098
01:16:31,018 --> 01:16:33,048
Lord Li said there's a signal.

1099
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:34,617
Oh. Oh, oh.

1100
01:16:58,918 --> 01:17:00,348
Use the Hoop!

1101
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:01,515
Sun and moon, of sea and sand,

1102
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:03,384
Qiankun Hoop, obey my command!

1103
01:17:15,751 --> 01:17:17,282
Hold!

1104
01:17:27,651 --> 01:17:29,384
Ne Zha! Ne Zha!

1105
01:17:32,717 --> 01:17:35,150
Dear? It's your mother.

1106
01:17:44,918 --> 01:17:47,450
Wait!

1107
01:17:58,551 --> 01:17:59,682
Please, wait.

1108
01:17:59,684 --> 01:18:01,882
Thank you for your assistance
today.

1109
01:18:01,884 --> 01:18:03,248
Tell me, what is your name?

1110
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:05,282
My name isn't worth knowing,
Milord.

1111
01:18:05,284 --> 01:18:08,181
Nonsense, I must make a toast,
to thank you.

1112
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:11,215
I have an urgent task
I must attend to.

1113
01:18:11,217 --> 01:18:13,916
I'm sorry. Let me get that.

1114
01:18:13,918 --> 01:18:15,217
No need.

1115
01:18:21,517 --> 01:18:22,415
A dragon!

1116
01:18:22,417 --> 01:18:24,115
Weren't they imprisoned
in the Eastern Sea

1117
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:26,515
by the Court of Heaven?
How did he get out?

1118
01:18:26,517 --> 01:18:29,582
I knew I detected
a familiar scent on you.

1119
01:18:29,584 --> 01:18:32,215
But that mark on your head
confirms my suspicions.

1120
01:18:32,217 --> 01:18:33,849
That sigil!

1121
01:18:33,851 --> 01:18:36,250
So the dragons stole
the Spirit Pearl.

1122
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,815
I could chase you if I wanted!

1123
01:18:39,817 --> 01:18:42,348
What else would you expect from
a bunch of dragons?

1124
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,916
No wonder
your kind were locked away.

1125
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:47,615
Well, you can't cross
the dragons.

1126
01:18:47,617 --> 01:18:49,916
So, the dragons
were the thieves. Figures.

1127
01:18:49,918 --> 01:18:52,250
The Court of Heaven
shouldn't have left them alive.

1128
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:57,016
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1129
01:18:57,018 --> 01:18:58,949
How unfortunate.

1130
01:18:58,951 --> 01:18:59,849
Brother?

1131
01:18:59,851 --> 01:19:04,181
For this to work
only four people needed to die.

1132
01:19:04,183 --> 01:19:05,448
But wouldn't you know?

1133
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:07,582
Now everyone sees what you are.

1134
01:19:07,584 --> 01:19:10,549
Now no one
gets to su-sur... survive.

1135
01:19:10,551 --> 01:19:11,982
Please tell me
you weren't involved.

1136
01:19:11,984 --> 01:19:16,016
I'm afraid I can't.
It would be quite rude to lie.

1137
01:19:16,018 --> 01:19:18,882
As for the Pearl, I stole it.

1138
01:19:18,884 --> 01:19:21,982
And Ao Bing is my apprentice.

1139
01:19:21,984 --> 01:19:24,248
Uh, have you lost your mind?

1140
01:19:24,250 --> 01:19:25,815
I'm gonna tell the Supreme Lord!

1141
01:19:28,018 --> 01:19:29,815
Good thing
I'm one step ahead then.

1142
01:19:29,817 --> 01:19:34,215
If you all die, there will be no
one left to tell him will there?

1143
01:19:34,217 --> 01:19:35,649
Apprentice,

1144
01:19:35,651 --> 01:19:39,815
there's only one thing
to be done.

1145
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:42,282
The survival of your people

1146
01:19:42,284 --> 01:19:45,183
depends on the next decision.

1147
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:51,181
<i>For the past millennium,</i>

1148
01:19:51,183 --> 01:19:56,448
<i>the Spirit Pearl has been
our only hope for freedom.</i>

1149
01:19:56,450 --> 01:19:59,515
<i>It's all up to you now.</i>

1150
01:20:20,217 --> 01:20:22,115
What is he doing?

1151
01:20:52,551 --> 01:20:54,849
He's trying
to bury Chentang Pass!

1152
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:53,181
A great deal of time
has already passed.

1153
01:21:53,183 --> 01:21:55,382
We should head back
as soon as possible.

1154
01:21:55,384 --> 01:21:57,551
Maybe there's something
we can do for him.

1155
01:22:00,684 --> 01:22:02,782
You can't leave,
you just got here!

1156
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:04,982
I, I'll die of loneliness!

1157
01:22:04,984 --> 01:22:06,248
You're being clingy!

1158
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:09,482
You can't break this curse

1159
01:22:09,484 --> 01:22:11,315
but there are ways around it.

1160
01:22:11,317 --> 01:22:14,115
Like a transplant spell.
You thought about that?

1161
01:22:14,117 --> 01:22:15,382
Yeah, but what does he know?

1162
01:22:15,384 --> 01:22:18,448
Are you gonna trust me
or an annoying cloud?

1163
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:21,282
I've studied with the Master
for centuries before you.

1164
01:22:21,284 --> 01:22:22,582
I know things you don't!

1165
01:22:22,584 --> 01:22:24,715
Let me show you
what talent looks like.

1166
01:22:24,717 --> 01:22:26,215
Yeah, okay, airhead.

1167
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:29,348
These guys are
Fate-Swapping Runes.

1168
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:31,682
Find a relative willing to
sacrifice their life.

1169
01:22:31,684 --> 01:22:33,582
Have them put one rune
on themselves,

1170
01:22:33,584 --> 01:22:35,582
and the other
on the cursed individual.

1171
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:39,282
And then instead of him,
the relative will go boom!

1172
01:22:49,884 --> 01:22:51,484
Ow.

1173
01:22:53,484 --> 01:22:55,282
Woah, hey! What are you doing?

1174
01:22:55,284 --> 01:22:58,115
I've decided to swap my life
for that of my son's.

1175
01:22:58,117 --> 01:22:59,549
This stays between you and me.

1176
01:22:59,551 --> 01:23:01,849
I beg of you,
don't tell my wife.

1177
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:03,916
Milord...

1178
01:23:03,918 --> 01:23:06,715
Ultimately, your sacrifice
would just go to waste.

1179
01:23:06,717 --> 01:23:08,782
The Demon Pill
will bring disaster

1180
01:23:08,784 --> 01:23:10,982
and the Supreme Lord
will never let him go.

1181
01:23:10,984 --> 01:23:12,649
The Demon Pill?

1182
01:23:12,651 --> 01:23:15,181
I will use the remaining
two years I have left

1183
01:23:15,183 --> 01:23:16,448
to make him a warrior.

1184
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,148
The people shall see him
as a hero.

1185
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:19,282
No, I can't allow it!

1186
01:23:19,284 --> 01:23:20,482
If you won't allow it,

1187
01:23:20,484 --> 01:23:22,916
when the lightning strikes
during the Heavenly Calamity,

1188
01:23:22,918 --> 01:23:24,048
I will die with Ne Zha.

1189
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:26,248
That's, that's so not fair!

1190
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:28,217
Uh, who is Ne Zha?

1191
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,751
He is my son.

1192
01:24:07,517 --> 01:24:09,582
Stop!

1193
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:13,751
Ah!

1194
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:17,615
That's strong armor!

1195
01:24:17,617 --> 01:24:18,617
Aim for the head!

1196
01:24:59,684 --> 01:25:01,048
Ao Bing?

1197
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:03,348
Don't waste your breath.

1198
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:05,715
Shen Gonggong?
What are you doing here?

1199
01:25:05,717 --> 01:25:08,215
It's Shen Gong-Bao!

1200
01:25:08,217 --> 01:25:10,982
Shen Gongbao was the one
who stole the Spirit Pearl

1201
01:25:10,984 --> 01:25:11,882
and put it in Ao Bing.

1202
01:25:11,884 --> 01:25:14,982
He wants to bury Chentang Pass
and everyone in it!

1203
01:25:21,183 --> 01:25:22,284
Stop!

1204
01:25:47,284 --> 01:25:49,115
Your power is limited
by that hoop.

1205
01:25:49,117 --> 01:25:50,448
You've no chance.

1206
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:52,717
I'll kick your butt!
Hoop or no hoop!

1207
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:05,350
Don't do this.

1208
01:26:08,717 --> 01:26:10,482
Ha! Too slow!

1209
01:26:10,484 --> 01:26:12,751
Fine. Then I'll ice you out!

1210
01:26:17,183 --> 01:26:19,617
Stop, my apprentice!

1211
01:26:23,117 --> 01:26:24,315
I'm sorry, master!

1212
01:26:24,317 --> 01:26:25,749
Ne Zha!

1213
01:26:31,984 --> 01:26:34,782
That's crazy!
What the heck are you wearing?

1214
01:26:34,784 --> 01:26:36,615
Transformation?

1215
01:26:39,417 --> 01:26:41,617
Come and get me! You scared?

1216
01:26:42,617 --> 01:26:45,117
Demon, there can only be
one of us.

1217
01:26:57,417 --> 01:26:59,215
Ah!

1218
01:26:59,217 --> 01:27:00,715
You better watch yourself!

1219
01:27:00,717 --> 01:27:01,949
I was holding back
this whole time.

1220
01:27:01,951 --> 01:27:04,849
If anyone deserves to be the
12th Golden Immortal,

1221
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:07,615
it's me, not an incompetent
fool like you!

1222
01:27:10,417 --> 01:27:12,982
Huh?

1223
01:27:12,984 --> 01:27:15,815
Hold on. Master entrusted you
with the painting,

1224
01:27:15,817 --> 01:27:16,715
not me?

1225
01:27:16,717 --> 01:27:19,048
Well, maybe he knew
you didn't deserve it!

1226
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:20,715
Very mature of you.

1227
01:27:20,717 --> 01:27:23,250
- But it's you who'll weep!
- Take that!

1228
01:27:33,851 --> 01:27:35,083
Coward!

1229
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:46,584
Huh?

1230
01:27:47,717 --> 01:27:49,684
Huh? Ha?

1231
01:27:54,651 --> 01:27:55,717
I've got you now!

1232
01:27:56,717 --> 01:27:58,682
Stop! I am your master!

1233
01:27:58,684 --> 01:28:01,617
Nice try. Next time,
pay more attention to detail.

1234
01:28:05,384 --> 01:28:07,515
Apprentice, let me help you!

1235
01:28:11,817 --> 01:28:13,517
That'll teach you!

1236
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,215
Great! Job well done!

1237
01:28:19,217 --> 01:28:20,582
You are too kind, Master.

1238
01:28:25,018 --> 01:28:27,615
Thank you, apprentice!

1239
01:28:31,751 --> 01:28:33,181
- Huh?
- Huh?

1240
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:34,682
Uh hey...

1241
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:37,183
Totally nailed that! Huh?

1242
01:28:48,751 --> 01:28:50,284
No!

1243
01:29:04,217 --> 01:29:06,551
- Who are you?
- Why... I'm your master!

1244
01:29:12,784 --> 01:29:14,450
Woah it's me, Ne Zha.

1245
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:16,849
Ooh! That's sneaky!

1246
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,083
Come on let's get out of here.

1247
01:29:21,183 --> 01:29:22,982
That brush is our only way out.

1248
01:29:22,984 --> 01:29:24,081
Get him!

1249
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:16,949
Ao Bing, grab it.

1250
01:30:26,651 --> 01:30:29,081
Hey, Ne Zha.
Grab the brush for me.

1251
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:36,282
Classy. But you can't
keep that up forever.

1252
01:30:36,284 --> 01:30:39,916
I, on the other hand, will never
run out of ammunition.

1253
01:30:44,217 --> 01:30:46,549
What was that you were saying?

1254
01:30:51,183 --> 01:30:52,815
Good one!

1255
01:31:08,784 --> 01:31:10,949
Uh, question,
where'd you learn to draw?

1256
01:31:10,951 --> 01:31:12,484
You try drawing with your feet.

1257
01:31:36,884 --> 01:31:38,215
- Huh?
- Hm?

1258
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:08,450
- Ne Zha! Ne Zha!
- Son! Son!

1259
01:32:11,217 --> 01:32:12,715
Ah!

1260
01:32:50,317 --> 01:32:53,982
Power of sun and moon,
of sea and sand.

1261
01:32:53,984 --> 01:32:55,715
Listen up, Qiankun Hoop,

1262
01:32:55,717 --> 01:32:58,382
and obey my command!

1263
01:32:58,384 --> 01:33:00,617
Can't lose myself. Gotta focus.

1264
01:33:56,784 --> 01:33:58,016
Stop struggling.

1265
01:33:58,018 --> 01:34:01,215
You were born the Demon Pill.
Why not accept your destiny?

1266
01:34:01,217 --> 01:34:04,248
'Cause it is not the boss of me.

1267
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:06,815
I'm the master of my destiny.

1268
01:34:06,817 --> 01:34:08,415
I'll be the one who decides.

1269
01:34:08,417 --> 01:34:11,083
And I will not be a demon!

1270
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:10,016
Huh?

1271
01:35:28,918 --> 01:35:30,083
Why spare me?

1272
01:35:30,817 --> 01:35:32,849
I told you.

1273
01:35:32,851 --> 01:35:34,350
You're the only friend I have.

1274
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:46,450
Well, my time's almost up.

1275
01:35:47,751 --> 01:35:48,782
You should leave.

1276
01:35:48,784 --> 01:35:50,782
But aren't you worried I'll...

1277
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,582
I thought
you were the Spirit Pearl!

1278
01:35:52,584 --> 01:35:54,916
I'm the Demon Pill
and I'm braver than you?

1279
01:35:54,918 --> 01:35:56,715
Don't be such a baby!

1280
01:35:56,717 --> 01:35:58,215
I'm a monster.

1281
01:35:58,217 --> 01:36:00,315
When I was born,
my fate was sealed.

1282
01:36:00,317 --> 01:36:01,482
You're not listening.

1283
01:36:01,484 --> 01:36:03,282
Your fate's
what you want it to be.

1284
01:36:03,284 --> 01:36:05,382
No one else gets to decide
what you are.

1285
01:36:05,384 --> 01:36:07,549
My father taught that to me.

1286
01:36:07,551 --> 01:36:09,782
If fate comes at you swingin'...

1287
01:36:09,784 --> 01:36:11,384
then you hit back.

1288
01:36:16,751 --> 01:36:18,148
Ne Zha!

1289
01:36:20,751 --> 01:36:22,551
Ne Zha! Release us!

1290
01:36:30,450 --> 01:36:32,715
I know you want to help but...

1291
01:36:32,717 --> 01:36:33,817
this is my fight.

1292
01:36:34,751 --> 01:36:36,150
Ne Zha! No!

1293
01:36:44,417 --> 01:36:47,782
Huh, you know
looking back on it...

1294
01:36:47,784 --> 01:36:50,016
Three years isn't that long.

1295
01:36:50,018 --> 01:36:51,717
I had fun while it lasted!

1296
01:36:57,284 --> 01:36:59,482
My only regret?

1297
01:36:59,484 --> 01:37:01,384
I never kicked
the jianzi with you, Dad.

1298
01:37:10,417 --> 01:37:13,117
It's my birthday.
No crying allowed.

1299
01:37:19,984 --> 01:37:21,181
Aw, man.

1300
01:37:33,651 --> 01:37:35,849
Dad. Mom.

1301
01:37:41,217 --> 01:37:42,517
Thank you.

1302
01:38:03,117 --> 01:38:05,615
- Ne Zha! Ne Zha!
- Ne Zha! Ne Zha!

1303
01:38:05,617 --> 01:38:06,751
Ne Zha!

1304
01:38:12,551 --> 01:38:15,115
- Ne Zha! Ne Zha!
- Ne Zha! Ne Zha!

1305
01:38:15,117 --> 01:38:16,815
Ne Zha!

1306
01:38:40,684 --> 01:38:41,749
Huh?

1307
01:38:41,751 --> 01:38:43,148
Are you nuts?

1308
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:44,617
Ao Bing, get out of there!

1309
01:38:45,617 --> 01:38:47,384
Dragonscale Armor!

1310
01:39:11,417 --> 01:39:14,415
He is ruining my entire plan!

1311
01:39:14,417 --> 01:39:17,181
I'm not done with you.

1312
01:39:17,183 --> 01:39:20,549
You've not seen
the last of me!

1313
01:39:20,551 --> 01:39:23,181
You're sacrificing yourself
for nothing.

1314
01:39:23,183 --> 01:39:24,382
You dumb or what?

1315
01:39:24,384 --> 01:39:27,549
'Course I am,
I'm your friend after all.

1316
01:40:08,517 --> 01:40:09,517
Huh?

1317
01:40:16,684 --> 01:40:19,882
I never expected it could absorb
this amount of power.

1318
01:40:19,884 --> 01:40:21,584
The Chaos Pearl has an appetite.

1319
01:40:28,018 --> 01:40:30,181
I can't take it.

1320
01:40:30,183 --> 01:40:32,217
I'm about to explode!

1321
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:39,148
You shouldn't have to...

1322
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:41,749
Let's give it back.

1323
01:40:41,751 --> 01:40:42,817
Right!

1324
01:40:54,083 --> 01:40:56,584
I can't hold on!

1325
01:41:00,517 --> 01:41:03,217
Ne Zha! No!

1326
01:41:04,651 --> 01:41:07,250
How dare they not invite me
to join in...

1327
01:41:10,651 --> 01:41:12,317
I love a good party.

1328
01:41:13,117 --> 01:41:14,649
Stay strong, you two.

1329
01:41:24,984 --> 01:41:26,083
Open!

1330
01:41:47,384 --> 01:41:49,415
Where are you? Ne Zha!

1331
01:42:12,751 --> 01:42:15,181
- How are we alive?
- Ha! We made it!

1332
01:42:15,183 --> 01:42:17,048
Well, not exactly...

1333
01:42:19,851 --> 01:42:23,148
The Multi-colored Lotus
couldn't save your bodies...

1334
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:25,215
but it kept your souls intact.

1335
01:42:25,217 --> 01:42:27,415
Whereas I'm pretty sure
I blew my chance

1336
01:42:27,417 --> 01:42:29,682
at becoming
the 12th Golden Immortal.

1337
01:42:29,684 --> 01:42:30,749
It cost me centuries!

1338
01:42:30,751 --> 01:42:33,115
Now I guess I gotta start over
again from scratch!

1339
01:42:33,117 --> 01:42:35,248
Thank goodness.

1340
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:38,782
I thought
I'd never see you again!

1341
01:43:02,951 --> 01:43:04,348
<i>If you asked me</i>

1342
01:43:04,350 --> 01:43:07,282
<i>whether a person
can alter their fate?</i>

1343
01:43:07,284 --> 01:43:08,551
<i>Well, I don't
really know.</i>

1344
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:12,482
<i>But hey, anything's
possible.</i>

1345
01:43:12,484 --> 01:43:14,282
<i>Because a boy
named Ne Zha,</i>

1346
01:43:14,284 --> 01:43:15,784
<i>forever changed his.</i>

1347
01:43:51,150 --> 01:43:52,949
Okay,

1348
01:43:52,951 --> 01:43:54,682
but, are you sure
we can't go out?

1349
01:43:54,684 --> 01:43:57,181
We, we're still waiting
on the signal!

1350
01:43:57,183 --> 01:44:00,217
So uh what exactly
is the signal?

1351
01:44:00,884 --> 01:44:02,749
You know...

1352
01:44:02,751 --> 01:44:03,982
That's a good question.

1353
01:44:09,150 --> 01:44:10,715
DON'T LEAVE!

1354
01:44:10,717 --> 01:44:12,517
THERE'S STILL
POST-CREDITS SCENE!

1355
01:45:30,851 --> 01:45:33,916
Ao Bing...

1356
01:45:33,918 --> 01:45:38,215
Everything we have worked for
was laid to waste.

1357
01:45:38,217 --> 01:45:43,450
And for that, I will make all
of Chentang Pass pay in blood.

1358
01:45:45,784 --> 01:45:48,982
Louder,

1359
01:45:48,984 --> 01:45:52,215
I don't think they can hear you!

1360
01:45:52,217 --> 01:45:54,782
Screaming into the void
like a child

1361
01:45:54,784 --> 01:45:56,684
won't change a thing.

1362
01:45:57,784 --> 01:46:00,682
We trusted you
to secure our freedom,

1363
01:46:00,684 --> 01:46:02,284
and you failed us!

1364
01:46:05,384 --> 01:46:08,749
Would you like to make a deal?

1365
01:46:08,751 --> 01:46:10,916
Dear brother?

1366
01:46:16,217 --> 01:46:17,415
DON'T YOU DARE LEAVE!

1367
01:46:17,417 --> 01:46:18,551
THERE ARE STILL
POST-CREDIT SCENE TO SEE

1368

Jiang Ziya ...

1369
01:49:27,751 --> 01:49:29,584
You know your sin.
